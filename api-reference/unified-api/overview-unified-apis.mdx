Unified API's primary goal is to provide users with a one stop place for integrating blockchain functionality into applications with reliability, latency, and cost in mind.

The provided endpoints in Unified API offer a variety of functionalities related to tokens (both fungible and non-fungible), and transactions, across multiple blockchains. The endpoints can be filtered by these categories:

## Token API

These endpoints provide functionalities related to fungible tokens (like ERC20). You can retrieve metadata about a token, query a specific address's balance, track token transactions, and query for token allowances. Learn more about these endpoints on our [Token](ref:token) page.

## MarketData API

These endpoints deliver real-time and historical market data from multiple exchanges. Access information such as cryptocurrency price quotes, market capitalization, trading volumes, and exchange rate data. Essential for financial analyses and trading strategies. Learn more about these endpoints on our [MarketData](ref:api-overview-market-data) page.

## NFT API

These endpoints are related to non-fungible tokens (NFTs, like ERC721 or ERC1155). These endpoints allow you to check the NFT balance of an address, retrieve detailed information about NFTs in a collection, track NFT transactions, and fetch metadata about NFTs or NFT collections. Start fetching with our endpoints shown on our [NFT](ref:nft-1) page.

## Transaction API

These endpoints focus on blockchain transactions. They enable you to retrieve a list of transactions related to a specific address or block and obtain detailed information about a particular transaction. Retrieve using our endpoints on the [Transaction](ref:transaction-1) page.

## Scans API

These endpoints allow for scanning blockchain networks for particular transactions, addresses, or blocks. Useful for monitoring network activity, detecting anomalies, and auditing transaction histories. Learn more about these endpoints on our [Scan](ref:api-overview-scan) page.

## Stellar API

These endpoints give access to Stellar Horizon Rest API for stellar mainnet and testnet. Learn more about these endpoints at [Stellar HTTP](https://docs.uniblock.dev/reference/stellarhttp).

## Webhook

These endpoints give access to our Webhooks API suite. Webhooks let you receive real-time notifications from Unified API whenever specific blockchain events occur, without needing to poll endpoints. Learn more about these endpoints at [Webhook](ref:webhook).
