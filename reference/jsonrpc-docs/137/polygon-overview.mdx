Polygon RPC

Use Uniblock's JSON-RPC endpoint to access Polygon with low-latency routing and a single API surface across providers.

## What is Polygon?
Polygon is an EVM-compatible mainnet.

## What is the Polygon JSON-RPC API?
The JSON-RPC API is the standard interface for reading chain state, sending transactions, and interacting with smart contracts where supported.

## Making API requests
Send a POST request to `https://api.uniblock.dev/uni/v1/json-rpc?chainId=137`. Include the JSON-RPC method and params in the request body.

## Supported networks
