## Introduction

Uniblock is an AI router for web3 that offers popular blockchain & market data APIs and jsonrpc. For every call, we determine the best provider to route your API calls based on reliability, cost and performance. And with additional features like automated fallback and automatic retries we make sure that your calls don't fail.

## Uniblock's APIs

Uniblock has a large range of APIs for users in the blockchain space. This includes the most used APIs like JSON-RPC which we have integrated into our router as well as APIs for tokens, market data and much more. Explore some of our offerings!

**Unified JSON RPC**

The bread and butter of APIs in blockchain and Unblock supports JSON-RPC calls across 100s of chains.

* [JSON-RPC](ref:overview)

**Unified APIs**

For users who need more control on blockchain data, whether that's token/nft contract address data or price endpoints with market data we've got you covered.

* [Token](ref:token)
* [Market Data](ref:market-data)
* [NFT](ref:nft-1)
* [Transaction](ref:transaction)
* [Scan](ref:scan)
* [Webhook](ref:webhook)

**Direct APIs**

We support a large number of providers and we aim to support all of their APIs. This is for users looking for a specific API method that doesn't already exist in Unified APIs from a provider that we support.
